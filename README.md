# Virtual Chimchar
This is a simple text-based pet care game made in C++ where you take care of a virtual Chimchar from Pokémon. It is designed to run in the terminal.

## How to Play
When you start the game, you will be introduced to your new Chimchar. You can give it a nickname if you want.

You need to take care of your Chimchar by:

- **Feeding it** - Type `feed` to feed your Chimchar. This will increase its hunger level.

- **Playing with it** - Type `play` to play with your Chimchar. This will make it happier.

- **Training it** - Type `train` to train your Chimchar. This will make it stronger.

The game ends when your Chimchar becomes an Infernape. Good luck trainer!

## Requirements
This program requires:

- C++ compiler

- C++ standard library

## Credits
This game was created as a small personal project to learn C++.

The Chimchar, Monferno and Infernape characters are properties of The Pokémon Company. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Pokémon Company.
